Every year, we buy more clothes than we need.
Attracted by trends, sales, and the rush of something new.

2.
But over time, much of it ends up here.
Thrown away, forgotten, polluting our planet.

3.
Behind every cheap t-shirt is a story.
A story of workers, paid little, working long hours in unsafe factories.

4.
The fashion industry is racing – designing, producing, and selling at record speed.
All so we keep buying more, and more.

5.
New styles appear every week. The pressure to stay 'in fashion' never ends.
But at what cost?

6.
Buy less. Choose wisely.
Support sustainable fashion – for people, and the planet.
